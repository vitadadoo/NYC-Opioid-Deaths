<div class="container">  <p> According to data from the CDC, the number of opioid-related overdose deaths rose 50% from 2019 to 2020 in New York City alone. The data continues to trend upwards for 2021, with a 20% increase in the year’s first quarter, compared to 2020. Even though deaths caused by the presence of heroin have declined in the city, deaths caused by cocaine and methadone spiked in 2020, and continue to surge in 2021. Across The United States, drug overdose deaths caused by synthetic opioids rose 30% from 2019 to 2020. The proliferation of fentanyl in recreational drugs, a synthetic opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and the COVID-19 pandemic, along with rising adverse mental health and city closures that motivated private drug use, contribute to these grim statistics. It is important to note that the presence of fentanyl in a substance, alone, is not cause enough for a person to overdose.

<p> This October, New York State Governor Kathy Hochul signed a legislation package that promises to alleviate the opioid epidemic in the City. Such legislation decriminalizes the possession of opioid antagonists (like Narcan), the sale and possession of hypodermic needles, and, most importantly, delineates a difference between “drug abuse” and “drug use,” in order to prioritize rehabilitation, as opposed to incarceration, for drug users. According to union leaders from VOCAL-NY, a grassroots organization that provides services for drug users, barriers to drug treatment in New York “[have] long forced [their] clients into needless suffering, destabilizing disruptions to their recovery, and serious risk of overdose and death.” </p>
